Welcome! This is the front page of my personal websites. My research interest includes data analysis and advanced machine learning (i.e., Federated Meta-learning) on transportation research. I have authored or co-authored 7 journal and conference papers. Currently, I work as a research assistant at Sun Yat-sen University and look for PhD position.

Ongoing Research Topics
======
1. Adaptive changes of spatio-temporal charging behaviours of electric vehicles entering the post-COVID-19 era
2. Spatio-temporal Prediction
3. Meta-learning for travel mode choice modeling
